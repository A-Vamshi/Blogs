# Introduction

Regression models, particularly **Linear Regression**, are powerful tools for predicting continuous values. However, they often suffer from **overfitting**, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. To combat this, we use **regularization techniques** that introduce a penalty term to reduce model complexity and improve generalization.

In this blog, we will explore **Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and ElasticNet**, covering:

* The **mathematics** behind each method
    
* **Comparison of results**
    

By the end, you'll have a deep understanding of how these regularization techniques work and when to use them!

## 1\. Linear Regression Recap

Before diving into regularization, let's briefly revisit linear regression. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost function:

$$\displaylines{ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sum(y_i - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^2 \\ }$$

where:

* y is the actual output,
    
* x is the feature vector,
    
* θ is the parameter,
    
* h(x) is the hypothesis function.
    

This approach works well, but it can lead to overfitting, particularly when features are **correlated** or **high-dimensional**. This is where **regularization** helps.

---

## 2\. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

### Mathematics

Ridge Regression modifies the cost function by adding an **L2 penalty**:

$$\displaylines{ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sum(y_i - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^2 + \sum\lambda(\theta)^2 }$$

where:

* λ is the **regularization parameter** that controls the penalty strength.
    
* The second term **shrinks the parameters**, reducing model complexity.
    

The solution to **Ridge Regression** is given by:

$$\theta = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1}X^TY$$

This prevents **large weight values**, reducing overfitting.

## 3\. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

### Mathematics

Lasso Regression adds an **L1 penalty**, modifying the cost function to:

$$\displaylines{ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sum(y_i - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^2 + \sum\lambda|\theta| }$$

Unlike Ridge, the **L1 norm** promotes **sparsity**, meaning it forces some weights to become exactly zero. This is useful for **feature selection**.

$$\theta = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1}X^TY$$

---

## 4\. ElasticNet Regression (L1 + L2 Regularization)

### Mathematics

ElasticNet combines both Ridge and Lasso penalties:

$$\displaylines{ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sum(y_i - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^2 +\sum\lambda(\theta)^2 + \sum\lambda|\theta| }$$

This provides:

* **Feature selection** (Lasso behavior)
    
* **Weight shrinkage** (Ridge behavior)
    

ElasticNet is useful when **features are correlated**, where Lasso alone tends to pick only one of the correlated features.

## 5\. Comparison & When to Use Which?

| Method | Regularization | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ridge | L2 | Shrinks weights, keeps all features |
| Lasso | L1 | Shrinks some weights to zero (feature selection) |
| ElasticNet | L1 + L2 | Balances Ridge & Lasso, good for correlated features |

### Key Takeaways

* Use **Ridge** when you have many correlated features and want to **reduce model complexity**.
    
* Use **Lasso** when you want to **select the most important features**.
    
* Use **ElasticNet** when you have **correlated features** and want the best of both worlds.

## 6\. Conclusion

Regularization techniques are essential for improving the **generalization** of machine learning models. **Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet** provide different ways to prevent overfitting by **penalizing large weights**.

I hope this deep dive helped you understand these methods from a **mathematical and implementation perspective**. Try them on your datasets and experiment with different λ values!
